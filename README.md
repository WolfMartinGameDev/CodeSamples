This is a non exhaustive collection of code samples that I created or co-created in university courses.
Most of it is in C++ even though I have more experience in C# (hence the camel case), but that code is mostly protected by NDAs.
Furthermore, most of the C# code I could provide here was written for Unity Engine projects and I want this repository to stay neat and overseeable.
IDE, build or executable files are not provided either for the same reason.
All folders contain code samples that were created for university assignments.
Original contains code samples that were created through solo development.
Foundation contains code samples that had a framework provided.
Cooperation contains code samples that were created as group assignments and had a framework provided.
Libraries and large parts of the provided frameworks are left out from the code base so building might not be possible.
A lot of the code is also uncommented since the assignment for most courses was just to produce working code.
